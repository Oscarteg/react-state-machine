Suppose we wanted to create an app that displays a selected subreddit's posts. The app should be able to:

- Have a predefined list of subreddits that the user can select from
- Load the selected subreddit
- Display the last time the selected subreddit was loaded
- Reload the selected subreddit
- Select a different subreddit at any time
